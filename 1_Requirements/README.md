## **Wiper Control System**

## **Introduction**

In cars, a wiper control system replaces the standard wiper blade with an electrical component. In this setup, the ignition button (on the motor) will be controlled by a single switch in the ACC position. Switch on the wiper system with a second press, then vary the wiper speed with a third press, and finally turn off the motor with a fourth press. All of this was done with the help of LEDs and a simulation tool.A wiper is a vital component that removes rainfall or any other liquid from the windscreen of a vehicle. The previous method required manual wiper activation, and raising the wiper was a tough task. As a result, this system is being presented as a solution to these problems. The project's goals are to supply wiping systems for older automobiles, improve the system by using actuators and pull switches (using the same switch for various functions by stepwise switching), and manage engine and wiper speed with a single switch. This System regulates the wiper's operation speed in response to the amount of rain. This Wiper Speed Control System is utilised in all sorts of automobiles, and its primary function is to remove rain air drops from the vehicle's front screen.

## Conditions of Wiper Control System in order to work properly

1. Ignition Key Position at ACC-- The Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs.

2. Wiper ON: Wiper is OFF-- On press of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz.

3. Wiper OFF: Wiper is ON-- The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned in step 2.

4. Ignition Key Position at Lock-- The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs.




## **SWOT Analysis**

### **Strength**

Visual clarity.
Operation Silent.
The wiper does not stop in the middle of the window.
We can control the wiper speed using just one button.
Windscreen wiper is essential for keeping the windscreen sufficiently clean for driver's visibility specifically for modern high speed vehicles.

### **Weakness**

Increased Replacement Costs
Rubber Blades are required.
Wiper motor problems
A build up of snow or ice can cause problems like bent wiper blades, wiper arms that skip, or a blown fuse and other issues with the wiper motor. If you live in a snowy climate, you may want to consider premium beam winter wiper blades to avoid freezing joints.

### **Opportunities**

Now, virtually all automotive wipers are controlled by a microprocessor. Many wiper systems in cars today use a rain sensor to detect the speed at which the raindrops are falling on the windshield. A microprocessor evaluates the signals from the sensor to calculate the speed at which the wipers should move.

### **Threats**

There are a number of reasons why windscreen wipers stop working and these include:
torn wipers, broken controls, a blown fuse, faults with the motor, damaged arms, snow or ice covering, loose pivot nuts and a break in the wires.


## **4'W & 1'H**

### **Who**

Anyone who wishes to be safe and have clear visibility in bad weather.

### **What**

A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.

### **Why**

Switching between controls and wipers is simple.

### **When**

In difficult environmental conditions, such as a rainy climate.
A windscreen wipe is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window.

### **How**

After wiping the windsheet of motor vehicles, the LED displays the position of the wiper and returns to its normal state.
Wiper Control system is essential for keeping the windscreen sufficiently clean for driver's visibility specifically for modern high speed vehicles. The washer cleans the driver's side of the windscreen whenever required.
